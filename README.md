# COVID-19 Exploratory Data Analysis and Classification Model

Hello, welcome to my COVID-19 EDA and Classification Model study. In this study, exploratory data analysis (EDA) was performed first, missing data were analyzed and inferences were made. Data visualization was done to understand the structure of the data, and it was analyzed nicely. Then, a classification model was built using XGBoost Classifier. After the model was built, metrics such as accuracy score, AUC score of the model were calculated. Then, values such as recall, precision of the model were also calculated and interpreted. Here, recall was more important for us. At the end, it was calculated how much the independent variables affected the model while building the XGBoost Classifier model. Here, “Pneumonia” affected the model the most.
